# Podcast-summary
This Project uses Assembly AI's API as well as The API from Listen Notes
With Assembly AI I am able to summarize any podcast from the Listen Notes API it is extremly useful
A very basic web applicaiton made with Streamlit acts as the GUI.

Go to Listen notes and get the Podcast ID, Paste it in the text area
And after a few mintues the podcast will be summerized
